As a master's student in applied mechanics and currently performing research in the environmental geosciences laboratory of Grenoble University, my main topics of interest are data analysis and numerical model development to describe and to better explain phenomena related to climate change impact. On the other hand, it's my interest as well to be able to develop new techniques and new technologies that help us to reduce and/or decrease the negative impact of climate change for human kind and for nature. This way, I look forward to exploring especially new techniques that are been analyzed and studied nowadays, but where there exists a lack of literature or scientific development, for example, the techniques to directly extract CO2 emissions from the air, that allows to reduce the green house effect and global warming. Performing further research or studies on this fields, will allow to better understand the viability of this kind of technologies to know if they can be fully deployed at great scale.
